## My Amazing Game Engine

A simple work-in-progress game engine made in C++ with GLFW.

## Development

0. This was built on Linux for Linux. We use GLFW. Make sure that's installed. We use 3.3.10.
0 and a half. CMake implementation SOON!

1. Clone the repository to somewhere.
2. CD into the repo.
3. Make directory "bin" (`mkdir bin`)
4. Develop!
5. Run build.sh (`./build.sh`)
6. Run the built product (`./bin/mage` assuming you are in the root directory of the repo)
7. Make cool stuff!
