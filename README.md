A simple work-in-progress game engine made in C++ with GLFW.

## Development

0. This was built on Linux for Linux.
1. Clone the repository to somewhere.

`git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/hablethedev/MAGE.git`

3. CD into the repo.
4. Install cmake, glfw (3.3, most likely libglfw3 and libglfw3-dev)
5. Run build.sh (`./build.sh`) which will build and run `cmake .`
6. Run the built product (`./bin/mage` assuming you are in the root directory of the repo)
7. If it works, congrats! You have a development environment.
8. Make cool stuff!
9. Continue from step 5.
