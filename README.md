## My Amazing Game Engine

A simple work-in-progress game engine made in C++ with GLFW.

## Development

0. This was built on Linux for Linux. We use GLFW. Make sure that's installed. We use 3.3.10.  
1. Clone the repository to somewhere.

`git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/hablethedev/MAGE.git`

3. CD into the repo.
4. Develop!
5. Run build.sh (`./build.sh`)
6. Run the built product (`./bin/mage` assuming you are in the root directory of the repo)
7. Make cool stuff!
